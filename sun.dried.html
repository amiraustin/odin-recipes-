<p>Made with pantry and fresh ingredients, this sun dried tomato pasta is a super easy recipe that’s perfect for a busy weeknight. But you will love it so much that it’s worthy of a weekend meal too. Maybe paired with a glass of wine.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sun dried tomatoes are easy to find in the Italian food section at the grocery with the jarred olives, artichokes and other antipasti. If you prefer roasted peppers, you can chop them and swap some or all the tomatoes</li>
<li>Pasta: Penne rigate with ridges are what I like because they pick up the tomatoes and other ingredients. Corkscrew shapes like fusilli, rotini, cavatappi or gemelli are also great options.</li>
<li>Garlic is so important for the recipe.</li>
<li>Arugula has a nice peppery flavor. Lots of spinach is a good substitute.</li>
<li>Parmesan: Stirred into the hot pasta, the cheese melts right in. I also sprinkle more on top as I serve it</li>
<li>Olive oil: Definitely use extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Red pepper flakes add a little bit of heat</li>
<li>Salt & pepper: Taste the pasta and add more seasonings as needed to the final dish.</li>
<li>Parsley is a final herby finishing garnish. You could also use fresh basil.</li>
