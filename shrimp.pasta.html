  <p>garlic shrimp pasta is an elegant pasta dish with big flavors! It's so quick and easy, and perfect for a weeknight dinner.</p> 
  <h3>ingredients list</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Shrimp – Use good quality raw frozen shrimp that is peeled, or peel and devein it yourself. Any size of shrimp works here as long as you don’t overcook it.</li>
  <li>Olive oil, butter, and garlic – this is where most of the flavor comes from</li>
 <li>Pasta – any long strand pasta of choice, I went for linguine.</li>
<li>Cream – heavy cream (double cream in the UK) works best here, the fat content of heavy cream is emulsified with the reserved pasta cooking water, and creates a beautiful silky cream sauce that clings into the past</li>
<li>armesan – get the best parmesan that you can get your hands on! It gives you that umami/savory flavor that you want in the sauce, and it also helps thicken the cream sauce</li>
